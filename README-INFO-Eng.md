We are creating an English version of the README that conveys the same manifesto and principles.
The goal is to appeal to a global audience while maintaining the same tone of transparency, community focus, and opposition to centralized practices in DeFi.

DBTC & Decentralized AMM: A Manifesto for True Decentralization
🎯 We're Not Your Typical Token
Warning: This is not a project to enrich developers while leaving the community empty-handed.
We don't promise yachts, villas, or easy gains. We're here to build something different: a fair, transparent, and sustainable economic ecosystem where created value is redistributed to the community that supports it.

❌ The Problem We're Solving
The current DeFi landscape has become hypocritical: DEXs that call themselves "decentralized" but censor tokens, platforms that preach freedom but apply gatekeeper logic, projects that raise millions only to abandon them.

Centralization hides behind false security flags:

They block tokens with transparent fees by labeling them "tax tokens"

They exclude protection mechanisms (pausable) designed for security

They create monopolies under the false name of "standards"

💡 Our Philosophy: Total Transparency, Clear Costs
Nothing is Free, Everything is Declared
In the real world, everything has a cost:

Developer → 1% fee (for continuous development and innovation)

DAO Treasury → 2% fee (for sustainability and community initiatives)

Audits, Servers, Infrastructure → Funds from DAO treasury

Unlike many projects that hide costs or impose them later, we declare them OPENLY from the start.

Why the "Pausable" Function?
It's not control, it's responsibility:

Protection in case of critical bugs in staking or governance

Emergency tool managed ONLY by multisig (not by an individual)

Security mechanism to protect USERS, not to control them

🏗️ Our AMM: The Answer to Censorship
We built our own Automated Market Maker because:

"If they close the doors, we build a new house where all ideas are welcome."

Unique Features:

✅ No censorship based on different tokenomics

✅ Native support for advanced mechanisms (fees, complex staking, DAO integration)

✅ Real governance through transparent multisig

✅ Everything open-source and verifiable

🔍 How We Ensure Transparency
All transactions public - From DAO treasury to developer fees

Multisig with known community members - No unilateral decisions

Constant social media updates - Successes AND failures, all shared

Complete documentation - No "black boxes"

Public audits - We pay for security, not for publicity

🌱 An Economic Model That Doesn't Exploit, But Sustains
Component	Percentage	Destination	Transparency
DAO Fee	2%	Project sustainability, audits, bounties, community initiatives	Multisig wallet visible to all
Development Fee	1%	Compensating developers, designers, maintenance	Public addresses, verifiable amounts
Liquidity Provider	Variable	Those actively supporting the ecosystem	Directly to their wallets
🛡️ Our Cultural Battle
We're not just fighting to list a token. We're fighting for:

1. Against the "take the money and run" mentality
Many in crypto just want to get rich quick. We want to build something lasting.

2. Against masked centralization
DEXs that censor, projects with anonymous teams controlling everything, "decentralization" in name only.

3. For a sustainable economic model
Where costs are clear, benefits are redistributed, and the community has real power.

🤝 How to Participate (If You Share Our Values)
For Users:
Discover if you believe in our philosophy - Read everything, ask questions

Join the discussions - Social channels are open, not just for announcements

Use our AMM - Support a real alternative

For Developers/Supporters:
Examine the code - Everything is on GitHub

Propose improvements - Through our DAO

Build with us - We're looking for talents who believe in the mission

📜 Our Non-Negotiable Principles
Never deceive the community

Never hide costs or risks

Never centralize control

Never censor for convenience

Never promise the impossible

🚀 What You Can Expect (Realistically)
A project trying to do the right thing, not the most profitable thing

Honest communication about progress and difficulties

Open access to all relevant data

A community based on values, not speculation

⚠️ Honest Disclaimer
This is NOT an investment to get rich quickly.
It's an economic-social experiment attempting to prove that crypto can be done differently. It might fail. It might have technical issues. It will definitely face criticism.

But at least it will be transparent to the core.

Join us only if you believe true economic freedom comes from redistribution, not accumulation. Only if you think transparency is more important than easy gains. Only if you're tired of the hypocrisies in current DeFi.

Let's build something different together. Or fail trying.
